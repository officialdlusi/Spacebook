  Spacebook is a React Native social media, mobile application designed for astronauts. A API server, was created allowing for there to be several endpoints such as editing a post, needed to be met. Through the given YAML file, there was an ablility to see the how the server would require methods to be done, in order to make sure the application fully functional.

  Base code was given to us to allow for an ability to meet the beggining endpoints and get started, on the application via GitHub and Postman was used to see if the methods were sending to the server.

  When creating the application I used Visual Studio Code and Github. This allowed for me to be able to push on several occasions, while making meainingful comments, have version control and install helpful tools via the extentions on VSCode. I adhered to a Linter, which allowed for a high level of code quality and layout. The Linter I used was the AirBnB Linter.
